***j. used an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype***

ITG used an iterative approach. The sections below provide a narrative and links to where feedback informed subsequent work of versions of our prototype. 

# 1 - Conception
When the RFQ was published, our chosen stakeholders gathered to brainstorm ideas.  After developing potential ideas around business cases and features, they invited the technical team to discuss and provide feedback from a practical perspective. We also collaboratively worked on mock-ups of a hypothetical application to facilitate discussions and generate a common understanding. From those ideas, the Product Owner created User Stories in JIRA and loaded them into the project’s backlog. This collaboration was documented in the [Project Charter](https://github.com/itgfirm/safe-food/blob/master/Evidence/a/ProjectCharter.docx). 

# 2 - Sprint Planning
With our set of stories in the backlog, we gathered the entire team for the sprint planning session. This consisted of working with the Product Owner to prioritize the stories and better groom the backlog; It also consisted of working with the technical team to size the stories into abstract categories of complexity and effort so that the entire team could better gauge what could be accomplished during the short sprint.  Both of these activities resulted in a very interactive conversation between the developers and the Product Owner which were documented in the story list that could be reasonably delivered in the sprint. 

# 3 - Execution
Once the sprint began, each day consisted of a scrum, a post-scrum discussion/follow-up, and demonstrations to the product owners.  We  utilized a collaboration tool called Slack for all communication between the previously mentioned events.  The scrums were short and collaborative where each development team member was able to report progress, plans, and issues.  The post-scrum/follow-up was a more “in-the-weeds” conversation time, where developers asked the Product Owner and the Architect detailed questions about their stories and had constructive dialogues to clarify and design the features that he was building. The demonstrations were similar to the post-scrum/follow-up, except that they were performed when some functionality was available. This provided an opportunity to get additional feedback from the stakeholders as well as perform additional testing and debugging.  Typically our team does not perform demonostrations within a sprint. However, given the agressive timelines, we felt that frequent demonsotrations were appropriate.

# 4 - Reflection
There were many points of reflection in our project resulting from technical clarifications on the API, demonostrations, and extensions/requirement changes provided by GSA.  Our team was able to openly discuss the issues and opportunities at each reflection point with our Product Manager and the entire development team. In most cases our team only needed to modify the story objectives or acceptance criteria for it to more closely align with the changing requirements. In some cases, we discussed changing the scope of the sprint by  removing specific stories from the sprint when they became obsolete or overly complicated.

# 5 - Pivot
From each Reflection Point, our team needed to pivot and be agile in our work.  During the tight collaboration required to modify stories and acceptance criteria, the developers discussed limitations and new ideas with the product owner, designer, and other proxy stakeholders.  The result was new implementations, new test cases, revised agile stories.  This level of accountability and transparency allowed the pivots to happen seamlessly throughout the project.

# 6 - Release & Retrospection
Upon completion of development and testing, ITG stabilized the code and deployment process to best represent a “production” environment. We also conducted a sprint retrospective with the development team and the Product Owner where we reviewed the effectiveness of our product and process. Each developer was able to express their thoughts and contribute ideas for future improvements. The Product Owner was also able to provide her perspective and similarly identify successes and suggest improvements.
