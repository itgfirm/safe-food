###Introduction
ITG is an innovative woman-owned small business that has since its inception adopted Agile scrum as its methodology to deliver complex cloud-enabled, mobile-ready, enterprise applications. Our customer portfolio includes GSA where we have developed agile systems including G-REX and EASi.
 
###Assembling the Team
Upon review of the BPA, the BPA response team rapidly self-organized and met to determine roles. We decided to work on the requirements for Pool 2 and chose the api.fda.gov/food/enforcement API because it allowed us to demonstrate a wider subset of our expertise including search and data analytics. To execute on the requirements we mobilized resources from our highly qualified pool of Agile Scrum trained professionals and developed a Project Charter.  Our Product Owner was selected based on experience with similar programs and understanding of the domain. Our team is comprised of a Scrum Master, and additional cross functional roles that include a solution architect, data architect, developers, testers, UI/UX designer, and analysts.
 
As customary, ITG’s Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) was engaged during Backlog Development to detail security requirements including collected information, storage, data usage and role based access.
 
###Selecting the Technologies
We finalized the technology architecture and selected modern tools for project execution. Leveraging DevOps principles we rapidly provisioned the necessary environments to support continuous integration, continuous deployment, automated testing and acceptance. Our environments were provisioned on flexible infrastructure with elastic resources, using Heroku’s Cloud PaaS.
 
To meet the requirements our Solution Architect selected
AngularJS, Mocha, and Node.js, New Relic and Git
LoopBack, a highly-extensible, open-source Node.js framework to create dynamic end-to-end REST APIs supporting secure data marshaling
New Relic to provide analytics and performance monitoring
Travis CI to support our CI integrated with SauceLabs to run automated tests
 
###Agile Execution
Our prototype was developed using our proven Agile Scrum methodologies (Figure 1) to deliver an application that provides informative data to citizens detailing food safety recalls.

We held a Backlog Development Meeting, led by the Product Owner. The Product Owner developed stories with acceptance criteria, and the Scrum Master led the team through grooming sessions to assign points to stories. Our stories included wireframes focused on human-centered design principles by our UX designer and test scripts from our QC specialists that ensured alignment with acceptance criteria, feature quality and industry accepted mobile responsive apps. Our architects developed the underpinning solution and data architectures and ensured alignment with GSA Enterprise Architecture (EA). Our target was to develop an evolutionary tool rather than a throw-away prototype.
 
Our first Sprint Planning Meeting identified the Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog. This enabled the Agile Sprint Board in JIRA to track work, velocity and progress. We began the sprint, and held daily standups.

Although our team was geographically dispersed, we ensured seamless collaboration, coordination, and governance through daily scrums and the Slack dashboard.  Slack provides us with complete transparency and an integrated view of the progress.
 
Our team employed additional tools to manage the development of this prototype.  ITG incurred minimal overhead in managing configuration by leveraging Atlassian Jira to maintain all artifacts throughout the development effort. Jira presents a global view of the progress using a dashboard for the Scrum Master and Product Owner, creating harmony and synergy as we built safeFood. We rapidly provisioned the Jira project based on existing ITG templates and used Jira with OSGi plugins to enhance and extend the integration with Travis CI, to support continuous integration.
 
Our Scrum Master monitored development progress and reallocated priorities as needed with the Product Owner who was subscribed to the Slack dashboard to provide immediate feedback enabling the team to work in 2-4 hour increments delivering functional stories.
 
At the end of each day, work was presented to the Product Owner. The Product Owner validated that each acceptance criteria was met. Any items outside of scope of the stories or acceptance criteria were added to the backlog. Also, our Team discussed what worked and what didn’t during the day enabling the Scrum Master to resolve issues through continual process improvement that increased velocity to meet our tight deadline. Upon completion of the safeFood project we held a meeting to discuss lessons learned.
 
As demonstrated in the provided Attachment E (INSERT URL), our safeFood app meets all criteria required for Pool 2. Our application represents the confluence of ITG’s highly experienced team, proven Agile Scrum practices, DevOps, tools experience, and federal standards.
